We want you to solve today's challenges in Javascript and in Python. For the Python challenges, we want you to use test-driven development (TDD) in the testing framework we taught you today. Though spec files are included with `driver code` (code to help you `drive` your development), they aren't as robust as unit tests. For Javascript, we want you to use [JEST](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html) as it will translate into React testing later well.

Quick note on today's assignments: `Whack-A-Mole` and `Mad Lib` have React starter code for you. When you clone the repos, be sure to run `npm install` to install all of the necessary dependencies. You will notice that the original code uses React class components -- you are welcome to refactor them into functional components if you so choose. Keep in mind that when you are keeping track of multiple state properties in a functional component, you will declare each one independently using the `useState()` hook. (So instead of having one state object with multiple properties, each piece of state will be a variable on the scope of the functional component.)

For today's challenge, you will create a Javascript module that calls out to the API. We've stubbed this out in `ArticlesAPI.js` - you need to write the code that goes in here (you will not need to explicitly create Promises).
