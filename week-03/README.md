# Weekly Topics:
- Recursion
- Data Structures
- Regex
- Python packages & Javascript libraries
- Assessment #2 at end of the week!

# Why is it important?
- Modules/Packages are essential to software development since it allows you to perform specific tasks without having to reinvent the wheel or solve a problem from scratch
- Recursion is important because it often allows a breathtakingly simple algorithmic solution to certain problems that would otherwise be practically unobtainable with an iterative algorithm.
- Understanding the basics of regex to help solve technical problems when other approaches are more cumbersome

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic?
1. Use modules/packages to help you execute your program more effectively
2. Ability to use Recursions to solve challenges
3. Use regex to solve challenges
4. Understand basic data structures
5. Know how to calculate Big O
