# Week 2 / Day 3

## Topics Covered
- Inheritance
    - Inheritance is one of the four pillars of OOP. Allowing classes to inherit similar attributes and methods from parent classes allows for code reusability and cleaner programs

## Goals
**Core**
- Inherit classes successfully
- Understand the different type of inheritance models:
    - Simple
    - Multi-level
    - Multiple
    - Heirarchical
    - Hybrid (i.e. combinations) 
- Understand the relationship between child classes and parent classes
- Understand the use of `super` in OOP and when to use it

## Lesson
**Inheritance**
- Inheritance is a relationship between two classes. Think of your relationship with your parents. All your features are inherited from them - your race, eye color, hair color, height, weight to some extent. But you are also very different from them. You have some different features and can do different things (methods) than them. Similarly in coding, let's say we have two classes - a parent and child class. A child class has the ability to inherit all the features of a parent class and any number of methods from the parent class can be overridden in the child class.

- A good way to think about this is `is-a`. Think of a parent class called Dog for example - what are some attributes to every dog and some methods available to every dog?

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, coat_color):
        self.name = name
        self.coat_color = coat_color

    def tell_me_about_yourself(self):
        print(f"My name is {self.name} and my coat color is {self.coat_color}")

    def bark(self):
        print("BARK")

    def eat(self):
        print("NOM NOM")

d1 = Dog('Spot', 'black')
d1.tell_me_about_yourself()
d1.bark()
d1.eat()
```
- In the example above, we say that every dog has an attribute called `name` and `coat_color`. Every dog also has the ability to `tell_me_about_yourself`, `bark`, and `eat`. If `Dog` class is a parent class, then any breed of dog `is_a` child of that `Dog` parent class and can `inherit` things from it. Let's say that we have a Poodle class:

```python
class Poodle(Dog):
    pass

d2 = Poodle('Lucky', 'yellow')
d2.tell_me_about_yourself()
d2.bark()
d2.eat()
```
- If you were to run the code above, we would see that the `Poodle` child class has the ability to do everything the Dog can do, despite having none of the code there! The `(Dog)` next to `class Poodle` is what does this for us. We can also override the `bark` and `eat` method on the Poodle class, since Poodles are better behaved than their parent:
```python
class Poodle(Dog):
    def bark(self):
        print('Ruff')

    def eat(self):
        print('Slurrrp')

d2 = Poodle('Lucky', 'yellow')
d2.tell_me_about_yourself()
d2.bark()
d2.eat()
```

- Finally, we need to talk about the concept of `super`. `super` is when you want to bring in the method of the parent class into the child class, but you also want to add in something else. Let's take a look at the following code:

```python
class Employee:
    number_of_employees = 0

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, pay):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = f"{first_name}.{last_name}@email.com".lower()
        Employee.number_of_employees += 1 # This line will increase the class variable "number_of_employees" across all instances of the Employee class

    def tell_me_about_yourself(self):
        print(f"My name is {self.first_name} {self.last_name} and my email address is {self.email}. I get paid ${self.pay} a year")

e1 = Employee('Rod', 'Levy', 100000)
e1.tell_me_about_yourself()
```

- As software developers, we always have to talk about the language we program in. Let's create a `Developer` child class that inherits from `Employee`:
```python
class Developer(Employee):
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, pay, language):
        super().__init__(first_name, last_name, pay) # This is so that you don't need to do all of those `self.first_name = first_name` things again.
        self.language = language

    def tell_me_about_yourself(self):
        print(f"My name is {self.first_name} {self.last_name} and my email address is {self.email}. I get paid ${self.pay} a year. I program in {self.language}.")

e2 = Developer('Josh', 'Alletto', 120000, 'Python')
e2.tell_me_about_yourself()
```
