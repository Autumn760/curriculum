## Lesson
Our first python app:
```python
## hello.py
greeting = "Hello World!" # creating a variable, and assigning it a value
print(greeting) # display variable contents to console
```

### Basic Syntax
- Python naming conventions use snake_case_to_name_items
- Python does not use any keywords to define variables (where as Javascript uses keywords such as `var`, `let`, and `const` to declare new variables)
- Python uses the `def` keyword to define functions
- Python uses newline characters (`\n`) as delimiters to end a code expression (where as Javascript uses semi-colons(`;`)
- Python uses tab characters (`\t`) as delimiters to define code blocks (where as javascript uses curly braces `{ }`)

#### *Javascript*
```javascript
function isGreaterThanFive(x) {
    if (x > 5) {
        console.log(`${x} is greater than 5`);
    }
    else {
        console.log(`${x} is less than or equal to 5`);
    }
}

let num = 9
isGreaterThanFive(num)
num = 2
isGreaterThanFive(num)
```
#### *Python*
```python
def is_greater_than_five(x): # function
    if x > 5: # if-statement
        print(f"{x} is greater than 5") # output to console, with string interpolation
    else:
        print(f"{x} is less than or equal to 5")

num = 9
is_greater_than_five(num)
num = 2
is_greater_than_five(num)
```

### Variable Types
```python

some_var = "A" # global variable => value is accessible anywhere (generally bad practice)
CONST_VAR = "B" # global variable, constant value (convention) in CAPS => value isn't intended to change

def my_func(x):
    local_var = "C" # local variable => value is only available in current function

    if x > 5:
        other_local_var = "D"
    else:
        other_local_var = "d"

    print(local_var)
    print(other_local_var) # variables are not confined to control blocks

my_func(9)
print(some_var)
print(local_var) # error
```

### Primitive Data Types
```python
a = True # boolean (can either be 'True' or 'False')
print(type(a))

b = 1 # integer
print(type(b))

c = 3.14 # float
print(type(c))

d = "donuts" # string
print(type(d))
```
- note there are a few more other basic data types, but these 4 are all you will need to know for now

### Non-Primitive Data Types / Data Structures
**list**
- an ordered collection of elements (values), stored at indices
- can contain any data type
- can contain duplicate values
- defined with values in square brackets, separated by commas
- similar to Javascript arrays
```python
my_list = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]
print(my_list[4]) # print out the item at index 4 in my_list

my_other_list = [1, "donuts", 7, [4,4,4,4], my_list, "Papa"]
print(my_other_list[3][3]) # ...what do you think this will print out?
print(my_other_list[4][5]) # ...what do you think this will print out?
print(my_other_list[5][4]) # ...what do you think this will print out?
print(my_other_list[5][5]) # ...what do you think this will print out?
```

**tuples**
- an ordered collection of values, stored at indices
- essentially to lists with one BIG exception!... tuples can NEVER be modified. Tuples are considered *immutable* data types
```python
my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
my_tuple = ("a", "b", "c")

my_list[1] = "B"
print(my_list[1])

my_tuple[1] = "B" # error!
print(my_tuple[1])
```

**dictionary**
- a collection of key-value pairs
- must use immutable data types as keys
- can use any data type as values
- similar to Javascript objects
- has ordering! (Python 3.6+)
```python
my_dict = {
    "some_key": "some_value",
    "other_key": 9,
    "donuts": "yummy!",
    "cupcakes": [1,12,5,44,7],
    7: "seven",
    (1,2,3): "numbers"
}

print(my_dict["donuts"]) # prints out the value associated with the key of "donuts"

my_dict["new_key"] = "Papa Platoon" # adds a new key-value pair
print(my_dict["new_key"])
```

**set**
- a collection of elements (values)
- can not contain duplicate values (i.e. duplicates are filtered out automatically)
- define with values in curly brackets, separated by commas
```python
my_set = {1,1,4,5,6,3,14,2,6,3,2,6,9,2,14,2,3,8}
print(my_set) # expected output {1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,14}
```

### Basic Control Flow
**if-statement**
```python
x = 9
if x > 5:
    print("The value of 'x' is greater than 5")
else:
    print("The value of 'x' is less than or equal to 5")

animal = "dog"
if animal == "cat":
    print("meow")
elif animal == "dog":
    print("woof")
elif animal == "snake":
    print("hiss")
elif animal == "bird":
    print("chirp")
else:
    print("no sound available")
```

**for-loop**
```python
## basic loop
for x in range(10):
    print(x)

## looping over list elements
my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
for x in my_list:
    print(x)

for i, x in enumerate(my_list):
    print(i, x)

## looping over dictionary entries
my_dict = {
    "donuts": "yummy!",
    "green beans": "icky!",
}
for k in my_dict:
    print(my_dict[k])

for v in my_dict.values():
    print(v) # same output as the previous loop
```

**while-loop**
```python
x = 9
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x = x - 1

## infinite loop
x = 9
while x > 0:
    print("la la la")
```

**`break` keyword in loops**
- aborts current loop (loop terminates)
```python
for x in range(10):
    if x > 4:
        break # abort loop, don't execute any other iterations
    print(x)

for x in range(10):
    for y in range(10, 20):
        print(x + y)
        if x + y > 25:
            break # only aborts inner loop (outer loop will continue)

while True:
    cmd = input("Enter a command: ")
    print(f"You entered {cmd}")
    if cmd == "quit":
        break
```

**`continue` keyword in loops**
- skips current iteration and proceeds to next iteration (loop continues)
```python
for x in range(10):
    if x > 4:
        continue # abort iteration, continue loop
    print(x)
```

**for-else**
- logic to execute if loops completes
```python
my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
for x in my_list:
    if x == "e":
        print("e found")
        break
else:
    print("e not found!!)
```

### Code Style
- Linters and Code Style
    - Other people are going to read and refactor your code, it's inevitable. Writing clean and readable code with the assistance of a linter will help your co-workers/partners

- If you think about driving a car in the US and driving a car in Hong Kong, the experience is the same because there is a style / standard that auto manufacturers must follow in order to sell a car. The same applies to the code that you write. A California-based software engineer writing in Python will have code that looks pretty much the same as a Russian-based software engineer writing in Python because of universally adhered coding styles.

- The good part about Python is that it forces proper indentation in order for a file to run. The proper indentation alone accounts for over 90% of issues that developers generally face. That being said, proper code style goes beyond proper indentation; it accounts for proper variable declaration, use of comments, etc. Luckily for us, we don't need to worry too much about those rules as the Python community has built a **linter** to notify us of errors in our Python code through [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting). Install this extension and run it whenever you write Python!

- Javascript also has a built-in linter that we'll cover in more depth when we get to React called [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
