## Lesson
Our first python app:
```python
## hello.py
greeting = "Hello World!" # creating a variable, and assigning it a value
print(greeting) # display variable contents to console
```

### Basic Syntax
- Python naming conventions use snake_case_to_name_items
- Python does not use any keywords to define variables (where as Javascript uses keywords such as `var`, `let`, and `const` to declare new variables)
- Python uses the `def` keyword to define functions
- Python uses newline characters (`\n`) as delimiters to end a code expression (where as Javascript uses semi-colons(`;`)
- Python uses tab characters (`\t`) as delimiters to define code blocks (where as javascript uses curly braces `{ }`)

#### *Javascript*
```javascript
function isGreaterThanFive(x) {
    if (x > 5) {
        console.log(`${x} is greater than 5`);
    }
    else {
        console.log(`${x} is less than or equal to 5`);
    }
}

let num = 9
isGreaterThanFive(num)
num = 2
isGreaterThanFive(num)
```
#### *Python*
```python
def is_greater_than_five(x): # function
    if x > 5: # if-statement
        print(f"{x} is greater than 5") # output to console, with string interpolation
    else:
        print(f"{x} is less than or equal to 5")

num = 9
is_greater_than_five(num)
num = 2
is_greater_than_five(num)
```

### Variable Types
```python

some_var = "A" # global variable => value is accessible anywhere (generally bad practice)
CONST_VAR = "B" # global variable, constant value (convention) in CAPS => value isn't intended to change

def my_func(x):
    local_var = "C" # local variable => value is only available in current function

    if x > 5:
        other_local_var = "D"
    else:
        other_local_var = "d"

    print(local_var)
    print(other_local_var) # variables are not confined to control blocks

my_func(9)
print(some_var)
print(local_var) # error
```

### Primitive Data Types
```python
a = True # boolean (can either be 'True' or 'False')
print(type(a))

b = 1 # integer
print(type(b))

c = 3.14 # float
print(type(c))

d = "donuts" # string
print(type(d))
```
- note there are a few more other basic data types, but these 4 are all you will need to know for now

### Non-Primitive Data Types / Data Structures
**list** 
- an ordered collection of elements (values), stored at indices
- can contain any data type
- can contain duplicate values
- defined with values in square brackets, separated by commas
- similar to Javascript arrays
```python
my_list = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]
print(my_list[4]) # print out the item at index 4 in my_list

my_other_list = [1, "donuts", 7, [4,4,4,4], my_list, "Papa"]
print(my_other_list[3][3]) # ...what do you think this will print out?
print(my_other_list[4][5]) # ...what do you think this will print out?
print(my_other_list[5][4]) # ...what do you think this will print out?
print(my_other_list[5][5]) # ...what do you think this will print out?
```

**tuple**
- an ordered collection of values, stored at indices
- essentially to lists with one BIG exception!... tuples can NEVER be modified. Tuples are considered *immutable* data types
```python
my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
my_tuple = ("a", "b", "c")

my_list[1] = "B"
print(my_list[1])

my_tuple[1] = "B" # error!
print(my_tuple[1])
```

**dictionary**
- a collection of key-value pairs
- must use immutable data types as keys
- can use any data type as values
- similar to Javascript objects
- has ordering! (Python 3.6+)
```python
my_dict = {
    "some_key": "some_value",
    "other_key": 9,
    "donuts": "yummy!",
    "cupcakes": [1,12,5,44,7],
    7: "seven",
    (1,2,3): "numbers"
}

print(my_dict["donuts"]) # prints out the value associated with the key of "donuts"

my_dict["new_key"] = "Papa Platoon" # adds a new key-value pair
print(my_dict["new_key"])
```

**set**
- a collection of elements (values)
- can not contain duplicate values (i.e. duplicates are filtered out automatically)
- define with values in curly brackets, separated by commas
```python
my_set = {1,1,4,5,6,3,14,2,6,3,2,6,9,2,14,2,3,8}
print(my_set) # expected output {1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,14}
```

### Basic Control Flow
**if-statement**
```python
x = 9
if x > 5:
    print("The value of 'x' is greater than 5")
else:
    print("The value of 'x' is less than or equal to 5")

animal = "dog"
if animal == "cat":
    print("meow")
elif animal == "dog":
    print("woof")
elif animal == "snake":
    print("hiss")
elif animal == "bird":
    print("chirp")
else:
    print("no sound available")
```

**for-loop**
```python
## basic loop
for x in range(10):
    print(x)

## looping over list elements
my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
for x in my_list:
    print(x)

for i, x in enumerate(my_list):
    print(i, x)

## looping over dictionary entries
my_dict = {
    "donuts": "yummy!",
    "green beans": "icky!",
}
for k in my_dict:
    print(my_dict[k])

for v in my_dict.values():
    print(v) # same output as the previous loop
```

**while-loop**
```python
x = 9
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x = x - 1

## infinite loop
x = 9
while x > 0:
    print("la la la") 
```

**`break` keyword in loops**
- aborts current loop (loop terminates)
```python
for x in range(10):
    if x > 4:
        break # abort loop, don't execute any other iterations
    print(x)

for x in range(10):
    for y in range(10, 20):
        print(x + y)
        if x + y > 25:
            break # only aborts inner loop (outer loop will continue)

while True:
    cmd = input("Enter a command: ")
    print(f"You entered {cmd}")
    if cmd == "quit":
        break
```

**`continue` keyword in loops**
- skips current iteration and proceeds to next iteration (loop continues)
```python
for x in range(10):
    if x > 4:
        continue # abort iteration, continue loop
    print(x)
```

**for-else**
- logic to execute if loops completes
```python
my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
for x in my_list:
    if x == "e":
        print("e found")
        break
else:
    print("e not found!!)
```

## Python Libraries
- For all languages, libraries, frameworks, and packages are just thousands of lines of code that someone else wrote ahead of time to make your life as a developer easier. There is no magic here - it's just meant to make your life easier and for you to make more robust applications
- There are a number of package managers to manage the different Python libraries we will use. The two most popular ones are Pip and Anaconda. Pip is more for web development where Anaconda is more for data science and analytics. The one you choose will largely depend on what you do more of
- You can find some very useful libraries [here](https://pythontips.com/2013/07/30/20-python-libraries-you-cant-live-without/). We'll be using Django in the next few weeks. If you go the data science route, there are some data science heavy libraries like NumPy and Pandas
- Please note that the majority of these libraries are backend libraries meaning that there's not a ton of frontend code to make it pretty

## Python Modules
Using modules in Python allow for you as the author to organize your code and group it together for ease of use. To put it very simply, a module is a file of Python code that you bring into other files. Let's take a look at an example:
```python
## file1.py
def say_hello():
    print('Hey there')

## file2.py
import file1
import file1 as anything
anything.say_hello()
```
We just created two files: `file1.py` and `file2.py`. `file1.py` has a `say_hello` function. `file2.py` has nothing in it, but imports that file in as the name of the file and we can use all the methods in that file. We can also rewrite it as `import file1 as anything` and call `anything.say_hello()`. You can `import` anything into your file by providing the correct relative path to the file. More on that can be found under external resources.
