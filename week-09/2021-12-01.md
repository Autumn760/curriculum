## Topics Covered
- **React**
  - Continue to build upon News Site React Challenge
- **Component Lifecycle**
  - Each React component has a lifecycle and understanding the component lifecycle will help you understand the data flow and when certain components should render/update/mount.
  - Lifecycle methods determine what is executed at what time in the component's lifecycle
  - React hooks are the new way to implement lifecycle methods into functional components.

## Goals
**Core**
- Understand the component lifecycle
- Understand the different lifecycle methods
- An introduction to React Hooks.

## Lesson

**Component Lifecycle**
Let's talk through a concept called the "Component Lifecycle" for React. Below we are start with a component in its natural state:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
        </div>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Our component could also have a `constructor` that allows us to add `state` and/or `props`:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    articles: []
  }
  
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state.something = props.something || "something";
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
        </div>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

You may or may not have seen `componentDidMount()` show up in your code:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    articles: []
  }

  componentDidMount() {}

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
        </div>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

`ComponentDidMount` is one of the [lifecycle methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle) that comes built into React Components. These lifecycle methods basically allow you to hook into a component at that specific point in their "life" to achieve various things. This [image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XcGM-8E_hGl4fpAr9wJIsA.png) demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a React Component for `mounting`, `updating`, and `unmounting`. Most of the time, you'll only use a couple of these lifecycle methods: `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`.

Here is a [Lifecycle method diagram](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/) that shows you what Lifecycle method executes during what point in the component's 'life'.

`componentDidMount` is most commonly used when you call out to your API. `componentDidUpdate` is invoked immediately after updating occurs. This method is not called for the initial render. This is also a good place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props. When `render` is fired, that is the point when a component is `mounted`.

__NOTE:__ React Lifecycle Methods are only used in Class Components!

**React Hooks**
As React moves forward, React wants to decrease the use of Class Components and move towards using Functional Components. We have already been using the `useState` hook to update the current component’s `state`. But what if we want to update our functional component at different points in the Component's Lifecycle. In Class Components we have built in Lifecycle Methods such as `componentDidMount`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, and `componentDidUpdate` that can perform operations at different points in the component’s lifecycle but in Functional Components we have the React Hook called [`useEffect`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html). You can think of the `useEffect` Hook as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` combined.

__Example of `useEffect`__

```javascript
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [titles, setTitles] = useState(null)
  const [makeAPI, setMakeAPI] = useState(false)

// useEffect is called when the functional component has mounted and when certain state data is updated
  useEffect(() => {
    if (makeAPI) { // the makeAPI state variable is initially FALSE
      getPhotosAPI()
    }
  }, [makeAPI]) // useEffect will only execute again if the makeAPI variable changes

  // getTitles functions sets the makeAPI state variable to TRUE
  const getTitles = () => {
    setMakeAPI(true)
  }

  // Makes a Fetch request to the API and then sets the returned data to state 'titles'
  const getPhotosAPI = async () => {
    let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos')
    let data = await response.json()
    setTitles(data)
  }

  // showTitle function accepts the titles state as an argument and maps through
  const showTitles = (titles) => {
    console.log(titles)
    let articleTitles = []
    titles.map((title, index) => {
      return articleTitles.push(
        <div key={index}>
        <img src={title.thumbnailUrl} alt={`color-${index}`}/>
        <p >{title.title}</p>
        </div>
        )
    })
    return articleTitles
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Using the useEffect Hook</h1>
      {
        titles
        ?
        <h2>Finished Loading</h2>
        :
        <div>No Titles</div>
      }
      {
        titles && <div>{showTitles(titles)}</div>
      }
      <div>
        <button onClick={getTitles}>Get Titles</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Today, as you start to wire up the `ArticlesAPI` JS module and connect to the API from your Components, you will want to use `componentDidMount` or `useEffect` for that (please see the example in the `readme` to help you).
